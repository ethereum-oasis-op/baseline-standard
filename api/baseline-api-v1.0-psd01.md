# 1 Introduction

The Baseline Protocol is an open-source initiative that combines advances in cryptography, messaging, and Consensus Controlled State Machines (CCSMs) often referred to as blockchains or distributed ledger technology (DLT) to deliver secure and private business processes at low cost -- event ordering, data consistency, and workflow integrity. The Baseline Protocol provides a framework that allows Baseline Protocol Implementations (BPIs) to establish a common (business) frame of reference enabling confidential and complex (business) collaborations between enterprises without moving any sensitive data between traditional Systems of Record. The work is an [Ethereum Community Project](https://github.com/ethereum/oasis-open-project), which is managed by [OASIS](https://oasis-open.org/).

## 1.0 IPR Policy

The Baseline Protocol API Specification is provided under the [RF on Limited Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr/#RF-on-Limited-Mode) Mode of the OASIS IPR Policy, the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established.

For information on whether any patents have been disclosed that may be essential to implementing this specification, and any offers of patent licensing terms, please refer to the Intellectual Property Rights section of the TC’s web page (https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/legalruleml/ipr.php).

## 1.1 Terminology

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in **[[RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)]**.

## 1.2 Normative References

**[RFC2119]** S. Bradner, "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" RFC 2119, DOI: 10.17487/RFC2119 March 1997, <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119>.

**[RFC4122]** Leach, P., Mealling, M., and R. Salz, "A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) URN Namespace", RFC 4122, DOI 10.17487/RFC4122, July 2005, <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4122>.

Testability Statement for all specification requirements: API endpoints can be tested using API testing platforms such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Since each API schema given in the requirements below specifies API responses using [RFC 2616 HTMl error codes](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616), and since each API schema has a given test fixture, all API specification requirements are testable.

#### **[R27]**

Creates a BPI `Prover` using the parameters provided in the request body.

Creating a prover entails compiling the prover from source, performing the appropriate setup or multiparty key ceremony and securely persisting resulting artifacts.

A `Prover` must be provisioned before it can be used to generate and verify proofs. The foregoing holds true regardless of which provider, proving_scheme, curve and prover identifier you specify (or source, if the raw source code of the `Prover` is provided instead of an identifier).

A persistent store must be implicitly initialized upon the creation of a new prover unless an existing identifier (store_id) is provided and the referenced store is valid in the context of the prover and authorized scope.

The parameters required to provision a `Prover` vary across providers and proving schemes.

# 10 API Security

This section gives an example of how to programmatically integrate API security using the example of the well-known [OAuth 2.0 authentication standard](#oauth-20) in a YAML formulation.

In accordance with the OAuth 2.0 specification, when a `Subject` is authorized and the requested `scope` includes `offline_access`, a refresh token is vended and returned on behalf of the caller. This refresh token is long-lived and can be used to authorize short-lived access tokens using the `refresh_token `grant type on subsequent authorization requests. This pattern is useful for machine-to-machine applications; a secure practice is to store the long-lived refresh token in a Vault instance (i.e., as a secret), read it into application memory during container initialization and then use it to authorize a short-lived access token. If the container remains running long enough for the access token to expire, the refresh token should once again be used to seamlessly authorize a new access token.

# 11 Conformance

This section describes the conformance clauses and tests required to achieve an implementation that is provably conformant with the requirements in this document.

## 9.1 Conformance Targets

This document does not yet define a standardized set of test-fixtures with test inputs for all MUST [R], SHOULD [D], and MAY [O] requirements with conditional MUST [CR] or SHOULD [CD] requirements. 

A standardized set of test-fixtures with test inputs for all MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements is intended to be published with the next version of the standard.

## 9.2 Conformance Levels

This section specifies the conformance levels of this standard. The conformance levels aim to enable implementers several levels of conformance to establish competitive differentiation.

This document defines the conformance levels of a BPI as follows:
* **Level 1:** All MUST requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.
* **Level 2:** All MUST and SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.
* **Level 3:** All MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.
* **Level 4:** All MUST requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by the test report defined in this document that proves the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on test-fixtures with test-fixture inputs as defined in this document. **This conformance level cannot yet be achieved since there is not yet a defined set of standardized test-fixtures and test-inputs**.
* **Level 5:** All MUST and SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by the test report defined in this document that proves the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on test-fixtures with test-fixture inputs as defined in this document. **This conformance level cannot yet be achieved since there is not yet a defined set of standardized test-fixtures and test-inputs**.
* **Level 6:** All MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by the test report defined in this document that proves the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on test-fixtures with test-fixture inputs as defined in this document. **This conformance level cannot yet be achieved since there is not yet a defined set of standardized test-fixtures and test-inputs**.

#### **[D1]** 
A claim that a Baseline Protocol API implementation conforms to this specification SHOULD describe a testing procedure carried out for each requirement to which conformance is claimed, that justifies the claim with respect to that requirement.

[[D1]](#d1) testability: Since each of the non-conformance-target requirements in this documents is testable, so must be the totality of the requirements in this document. Therefore, conformance tests for all requirements can exist, and can be described as required in [[D1]](#d1).

#### **[R43]** 
A claim that a Baseline API implementation conforms to this specification at **Level 2** or higher MUST describe the testing procedure carried out for each requirement at **Level 2** or higher, that justifies the claim to that requirement.

As stated in the OASIS IPR Policy, the following three paragraphs in brackets apply to OASIS Standards Final Deliverable documents (Project Specifications, OASIS Standards, or Approved Errata).

\[OASIS requests that any OASIS Party or any other party that believes it has patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, to notify OASIS TC Administrator and provide an indication of its willingness to grant patent licenses to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Open Project that produced this deliverable.\]

\[OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is aware of a claim of ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable by a patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Open Project that produced this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable. OASIS may include such claims on its website but disclaims any obligation to do so.\]

\[OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable or the extent to which any license under such rights might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such rights. Information on OASIS' procedures with respect to rights in any document or deliverable produced by an OASIS Open Project can be found on the OASIS website. Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, can be obtained from the OASIS TC Administrator. OASIS makes no representation that any information or list of intellectual property rights will at any time be complete, or that any claims in such list are, in fact, Essential Claims.\]

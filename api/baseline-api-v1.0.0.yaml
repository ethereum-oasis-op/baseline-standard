        Returns a `bearer` API token for the a specified `User`. 
        
        The presence of a `bearer` API token is required to authorize most Baseline API calls. A `bearer` API token is an encoded JWT which contains a subject claim (`sub`) which references an authorized entity (i.e., the `User`, `Application` or `Organization`). The authorized entity uses a signed `bearer` authorization Token to access one or more resources for which the Token was authorized. Unless otherwise noted, all API requests must include a header such as `Authorization: bearer <jwt>`.

      description: |-
        Configuring a new peer-to-peer network can be quite complex. Just how complex depends on the kind of network you intend to provision, and the clients and protocols you plan to support (both now, and in the future). Creating the configuration for a new logical network involves having deep understanding of your goals for the network and the underlying consensus and governance protocols. 

        We plan to curate some examples demonstrating how to configure extensible new EVM- and Bitcoin-based networks and will update this documentation accordingly.

      summary: Create transaction
      description: >
        Create and broadcast a transaction in a chain- and protocol-agnostic manner.


        This API provides an asynchronous, fault-tolerant mechanism for providing some guarantees about how a well-formed transaction will become eventually-consistent with the underlying target Network. Currently, transactions are guaranteed to be successfully broadcast to the target network or timeout within 5 minutes. If a transaction is unable to be broadcast to the network for any reason (i.e., network reachability, invalid nonce etc.) it is retried every 60 seconds. It is likely these
        retry and timeout constraints will be made more configurable in a future release.


        In addition to the asynchronous and resilient nature of broadcasting transactions using this API, instrumentation of the full transaction lifecycle is captured for each transaction.

      summary: Create circuit
      description: |
        Creates a baselined `Circuit`.

        You must provision a circuit before it can be used to generate and verify proofs. The foregoing holds true regardless of which provider, proving_scheme, curve and circuit identifier you specify (or source, if the raw source code of the `Circuit` is provided instead of an identifier).

        A powerful aspect of this API is the asynchronous nature by which computationally-intensive cryptographic operations are executed. The lifecycle of a zero-knowledge circuit depends largely on the chosen proving_scheme. For example, zkSNARK proving schemes (i.e., groth16) require a trusted setup whereas more modern schemes (i.e., plonk) do not.

        A persistent store is implicitly initialized upon the creation of a new circuit unless an existing store_id is provided and the referenced store is valid in the context of the circuit and authorized `scope`.

      summary: JSON Web Key Set (JWK)
      description: |-
        Returns JSON Web Key Set (JWK). 

        The JSON Web Key Set (JWK) is a set of keys containing the public keys used to verify any JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by the authorization server and signed using the RS256 signing algorithm.

        When creating applications and APIs in a Provide ecosystem, two algorithms are supported for signing JWTs: RS256 and HS256. RS256 generates an asymmetric signature, which means a private key must be used to sign the JWT and a different public key must be used to verify the signature.

        Provide uses the JSON Web Key (JWK) specification to represent the cryptographic keys used for signing RS256 tokens. This specification defines two high-level data structures: JSON Web Key (JWK) and JSON Web Key Set (JWKS).

        This endpoint will contain the JWK used to sign all issued JWTs for this tenant.

        Retrieves secret OpenID configuration. 

        Openid-configuration is a Well-known URI Discovery Mechanism for the Provider Configuration URI and is defined in OpenID Connect.

        Openid-configuration is a URI defined within OpenID Connect which provides configuration information about the Identity Provider (IDP).

        Openid-configuration is the OpenID Connect Provider's discovery document. The discovery document describes the provider's API endpoints used during the authentication sequence. Specifying this URL connects the authenticator to a particular OpenID Connect Provider. For Example, for Google (including Google Apps), the discovery document URL

        The Openid-configuration publishes a JSON object listing the Provider's OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Endpoints as well as the supported grants, response types, authentication methods and security algorithms. These details are needed by clients and application developers to construct requests to the server.

        A `Workgroup` represents a logical collection of resourcess provisioned within the baseline containerized microservices architecture. An `Workgroup` is immutably configured upon initialization with support for a primary 'Network'.
        Access to programmatically manage resources associated with an `Workgroup` is provided via REST API, to which ACL-based authorization is managed using generic permissions.

A `bearer` API token is an encoded JWT which contains a subject claim (`sub`) which references an authorized entity (i.e., the `User`, `Application` or `Organization`). The authorized entity uses a signed `bearer` authorization Token to access one or more resources for which the Token was authorized.  Unless otherwise noted, all API requests must include a header such as `Authorization: bearer <jwt>`'

      description: >-
        OAuth2 support. In accordance with the OAuth 2.0 specification, when an entity is authorized and the requested `scope` includes `offline_access`, a refresh token is vended and returned on behalf of the caller. This refresh token is long-lived and can be used to authorize short-lived access tokens using the `refresh_token `grant type on subsequent authorization requests. This pattern is useful for machine-to-machine applications; a secure practice is to store the long-lived refresh token
        in a Vault instance (i.e., as a secret), read it into application memory during container initialization and then use it to authorize a short-lived access token. If the container remains running long enough for the access token to expire, the refresh token should once again be used to seamlessly authorize a new access token.

## Overview

This folder contains the specifications for the Baseline protocol, a technique which combines advances in cryptography, messaging, and blockchain to coordinate complex business processes at low cost via the public Mainnet while leaving private data on traditional systems of record.

The main goal of this folder is to provide accurate reference documentation for the aspects of the protocol that are independent of language or implementation. 

In addition to describing the current state of the Baseline protocol, the specs folder serves as a coordination point and a venue to drive the development of the Baseline OASIS standards. 

## Status

The Baseline protocol specifications are currently a Project Specification Draft (PSD).

## Specifications

There are currently three specifications in PSD status:

OASIS Specification 1 - The Baseline CORE Specifications document: The document describes the minimal set of business and technical prerequisites, functional and non-functional requirements, together with a reference architecture that when implemented ensures that two or more systems of record can synchronize their system state over a permissionless public Distributed Ledger Technology (CCSM) network.

OASIS Specification 2 - The Baseline API & Data Model Specifications document: The document describes the Baseline programming interface and expected behaviors of all instances of this interface together with the required programming interface data model.

OASIS Specification 3 - Permissionless CCSM Requirements document: The document describes required and assumed properties and qualities of a singleton state machine and its operating environment for such a CCSM to safely synchronize two or more enterprise systems of record.
